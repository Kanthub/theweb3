## What is CpChain?

[CpChain](https://www.cpchain.com/) is a project dedicated to scaling Ethereum's technology and expanding its ability to coordinate people from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. The [CpChain Collective](https://www.cpchain.com/vision) builds open-source software that powers scalable blockchains and aims to address key governance and economic challenges in the wider Ethereum ecosystem. CpChain operates on the principle of **impact=profit**, the idea that individuals who positively impact the Collective should be proportionally rewarded with profit. **Change the incentives and you change the world.**
